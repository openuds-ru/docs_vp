# Introduction

PactumJS is a next generation free and open-source REST API automation testing tool for all levels in a [Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html). It makes backend testing a productive and enjoyable experience. This library provides all the necessary ingredients for the most common things to write better API automation tests in an easy, fast & fun way.

## Use Cases

PactumJS users are typically Developers, QA Engineers and SDETs. It enables them to write all types of tests against backend servers (REST APIs). No matter the programming language used for building the API servers, we can still use this library to write and run the tests against them.

> This tool will be a perfect fit for all kinds of API testing needs for **micro-services**.

### Notes

The original intention of building this tool was to reuse component tests written in [frisby](https://docs.frisbyjs.com/) for contract testing with [pact](https://docs.pact.io). As you might have guessed, it was inspired from both these tools. The initial versions of this library was compatible with them but later it went on to become an independent testing tool.
